I have attached a spreadsheet. It has two tabs. One says "bank" and one says "credit card"

WE WILL BE USING CREDIT CARD TAB
bank tab is to check your work


Credit Card Tab
There may be multiple transactions that make up a single deposit into the bank account.

1. This transfer schedule explains which transactions will go into which day.

2. We need to add a unique identifier to each set of transactions that falls into the transfer schedule. So for example if there are three transactions that occur on 1/1/18 before 10pm  then all three transaction will have the SAME unique identifier

Send me a quote showing you understand the issue by giving an example of transactions that would go together based on day of week etc

Please Including the amount of time it will take

In order to check your work you may use the Bank tab

BANK Tab
The first things is to identify all transactions that have gone into the bank.
1. In the "code" field a deposit from the credit card will have a code "XDEP"
2. The beginning of the description will have "External Deposit  Vantiv eCommerce"
3. The "amount" column will contain the amount of money that was deposited based on the credit card transactions
4. These transaction amounts should match the grouped transaction you create. So for example if you take three transactions that occured on the same day and they amount to $500 then you should have one bank statement amount that equals 500
